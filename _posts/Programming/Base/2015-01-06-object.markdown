In Computer Science, an object is a **location in memory** having a **value** and possibly referenced by an **identifier**.

An object can be a variable, a data structure, or a function.

In class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, object refers to particular **instance** of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.

An object has state (data) and behavior (code).
