MVC
===

Description
-----------

Modle-View-Controller is the concept introduced by smalltalk of encapsulating **some data** together with its **processing (the model)** and isolate it from the **manipulation (the controller)** and **presentaion (the view)** part that has to be done on a userinterface.

### Components

* **Model** directly manages the data, logic and runles of the application.
* **View** can be any output reprensentaion of the state of the model.
* **Controller** offers facilities to change the state of the model, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

The central component of MVC, *the model*, capatures the behavior of the application in terms of its `problem domain`, independent of *presentation*.
