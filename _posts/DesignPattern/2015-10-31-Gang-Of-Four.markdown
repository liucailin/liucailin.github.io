## Adpter Pattern ##

Allow the interface of an existing class to be used from another interface. It is often used to make existing class work with others without modifying their source code.

An Adapter helps two incompatible interfaces to work together. This is read word definition for an adpter. Interfaces may be incompatible but the inner functionality should suit the need.The Adapter pattern allows otherwise imcompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.
