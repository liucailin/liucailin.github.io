## Facade Pattern ##

It is often used when a system is very complex or diffcult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involes a single wrapper class which contains a set if members required by client.
